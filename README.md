# Orbitscape: A virtual Orrery for Navigating Planets and NearEarth Objects
The interactive orrery web application serves as a digital platform that allows users to explore and interact with celestial bodies in our solar system. By utilizing modern web technologies, the application provides a dynamic and immersive experience, where users can visualize planets, some moons, and asteroids.


## Description:
Orrery Web App is a web application that simulates a 3D orrery (model of the solar system). The frontend is developed using JavaScript and Three.js to handle the user interface and 3D visualization, while the backend, built with Node.js , manages the server-side logic and API.

This project is an interactive web application that simulates a modern orrery, inspired by the first mechanical model of the solar system presented to Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery, in 1713. Unlike traditional physical orreries, our application uses advanced digital tools to offer an enriching experience that showcases near-Earth celestial bodies.
